# Project Learning MongoDB
## Overview

Another project developed while studying the Back-End module of [Trybe](www.betrybe.com)'s Full-Stack Web Development course. It was designed to provide hands-on experience with MongoDB and its querying capabilities. The database used in this project contains information about McDonald's hamburgers. To study MongoDB, the following actions were performed using various queries and syntaxes:

-   Retrieving data from the database
-   Creating new data in the database
-   Updating existing data in the database
-   Deleting data from the database

The project aims to familiarize users with the basics of MongoDB and its querying functionality, providing a solid foundation for further study and development.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that is designed to store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently. It uses a flexible data model that allows for the creation of dynamic and complex data structures, making it easy to store and retrieve data as needed. MongoDB uses a query language similar to SQL, but with a syntax that is optimized for the JSON data format, which is the format in which data is stored in MongoDB. Additionally, MongoDB has a strong and active development community, making it easy to find resources and support when needed.
